How to play:
First of all, the game will ask you if you want to play or no. If you want to play you have to type in lowercase "y", if you don't want to, you press "n" in lowercase.
After you've pressed "y", the game will ask player 1 to type a word, please type it in lowercase. After that player 2 will type letters or maybe words to guess it, if the second player can't guess the given word in less than 10 tries, he loses and player 1 wins. If player 2 guess the word in less than 10 tries he wins and player 1 loses. At the end it will say who wins and who loses. After that the game will ask again if you want to play or not. If you don't want to play anymore press "n" in lowercase and the game will write the 2 players stats such as wins, highest win streak and who is the overall winner if there's a one.
